# Epitech Norm Linter
An Atom package that lints your code with a norminette

###### By [Arignir](mailto:tigearth@hotmail.fr)

## Use

* This package needs the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) package to work.

* When you save a file, a norminette will be executed and the result will be displayed using the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) package.

* This package works with the norminette made by duponc_j and all norminettes with same output. (Just edit the ```norm.py``` script).

## Debug

* If the package doesn't work, try another version of Python on the configuration panel. Python 3.x are recommended.

* If your problem persists, feel free to post an new [issue](https://github.com/Arignir/Epitech-norm-linter/issues) on the GitHub's project !
